# Machine-Learning-Proj4-GA-DE-PSO
Code for Project 4 of my machine learning class. Focus on the genetic algorithm, differential evolution, and particle swarm optimization to tune the weights of a multi layer perceptron used for classification/regression. This code is old and no longer updated. Many of these algorithms are more updated in other repositories.
